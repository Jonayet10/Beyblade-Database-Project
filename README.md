# Beyblade-Database-Project

This project features a database to store Beyblade parts from the Beyblade Metal Saga (Metal Fusion, Masters, and Fury). The functionalities of this database include (1) cataloging various aspects of Beyblade parts (generation, weight, qualities), (2) recording Beyblade battle outcomes (Beyblades and parts used, outcomes), (3) and serving as a respository for Beyblade enthusiasts and competitors who want to analyze and optimize Beyblade configurations for strategic advantages.

Admins can add new Beyblades and parts to the database, as well as record information regarding tournament and battle results. Clients can customize Beyblades, save them in their account, and find information and specs on Beyblades and parts.
